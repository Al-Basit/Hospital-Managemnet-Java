# **Hospital Management System (HMS)**  

This **Hospital Management System (HMS)** is an academic project developed for an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course. It is implemented using **Java Swing** for the user interface and **MySQL** as the database. The project adheres to clean code principles, advanced practices, and is entirely based on **OOP concepts** to leverage their power for scalability and maintainability.
